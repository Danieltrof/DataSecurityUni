Cryptography 
- Caesar Cipher C = E(p) = p + 3. E.g. A => D, B => E

- Mono-Alphabetic substitution cipher with K = 7. E.g. A = H, B = I

- Vigen√®re cipher (A-Z*A-Z) with K=ITPE, D = L, A = T.

- One-Time Pad: Encryption algorithm there the key is a random sequence of symbols and only used for one time. Key is destroyed after use.

- Random number generator: Key generation, Saltin, Nonces

- Modern cryptography: Symmetric and Asymmetric

- Symmetric Cryptography: same key for encryption and decryption

- Asymmetric Cryptography: a public (encrypts or verifies) and private key (decrypts or sings) used for cryptographic operations. 

- A good cryptography: 
	- Based on mathematical principles
	- Analyzed by experts and found safe
	- Has passed the "test of time" (no one has found weakness yet)

- Hash function: avoids encryption but maintains integrity
	- Given message m, easy and fast to calculate hash value h
	- Given the message m, hash function always produces same hash value h for same message m
	- Give hash value h, difficult to calculate the message m

- E.g. of hash functions
	- sh-2, sha-3
	- Blake, Blake2
	- ripemd-160, ripemd-256, ripemd-320
	- whirlpool

- Steganography: hide text. E.g. image or audio file
	Hide in image in linux using command steghide (If sender encrypted with passphrase, receiver has to have the same passphrase)
	steghide extract -v -sf star-trek-enterprise.jpg
		Enter passphrase:
	If succeeds, extracts message to file msg.txt

- Convert text to hash with linux
	echo -n 'HELLO' | openssl dgst -sha224
	cat testhashfunction.txt | openssl dgst -sha224
